	"game_info_howtoplay_description_cycles"	"HvH is divided into cycles of day and night. <span class='day'>During the day,</span> the Snipers reign supreme and must work together to hunt the elusive Night Stalker. <span class='night'>During the night,</span> the Night Stalker's improved strength, speed, and vision turns him into a Sniper-killing machine."
	"game_info_howtoplay_description_hound"		"<span class='unit'>The Hound</span> is a formidable ally to the Snipers. <span class='day'>During the day,</span> the Hound pursues the Night Stalker, even when the enemy is invisible. When the Hound stops, the Night Stalker lurks near! <span class='night'>At night,</span> however, the Hound must rest, and the Snipers are on their own."
	"game_info_howtoplay_description_items"		"<span class='item'>Special items</span> are also available to both teams during each day/night cycle. <span class='day'>During the day</span>, the Night Stalker can loot brown chests. <span class='night'>During the night,</span> the Snipers can loot golden chests. Move quickly or your team's chests will disappear!"
