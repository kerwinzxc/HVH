[b]WHAT'S NEW?[/b]
Hiya, it's been a while (Like the PHOENIX, I rise again). This update introduces the Phoenix, an immortal unit that will force the Snipers to play more strategically if they want to corner the Night Stalker. While collecting chests (now called Sun Shards), the Snipers will also gain Sun Shard items. These can be "fed" to the Phoenix to either increase the length of day or shorten night. The Night Stalker benefits from a longer night, and he'll do everything he can to make sure the Snipers can't use their shards.

I'll be keeping a close eye on the numbers, which may need to be revised soon. This patch should see a significant boost to the Night Stalker team. I'm not aiming for a perfect 50/50 win ratio, but I want it to feel more fair.

I've also heard a lot of complaints related to the neutral creeps in general, and I've been thinking about setting up some host options to allow more customization. That might be my next mission, followed by new maps and new game modes. Tell me what you think.

[b]HUNTER v HUNTED[/b] is a fast-paced 4v1 PVP mode that pits teamwork against terror. The balance of power is constantly shifting, requiring players to play offensively one minute and defensively the next. On one team, the four Snipers must watch each other's backs and follow the nose of their trusty Hound. On the other team, the solo Night Stalker must learn to divide and conquer by staging ambushes and cleverly evading capture. This game mode includes a tailored map, custom abilities, AI companions, items that grant Dota 2 abilities, and more. It is designed to be fun with groups of varying skill levels.

[b]OBJECTIVE:[/b]
Each team has limited lives. Kill the other team before they kill you! Games should last 15-25 minutes.
