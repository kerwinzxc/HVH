Version 1.4.0

[b]WHAT'S NEW?[/b]
There are now neutral creeps that can be discovered during your hunt. Check the update notes for details. I hope that the existence of these creeps adds a new layer of danger and dynamic, unpredictable gameplay. If you have observations or ideas for future mini-encounters, be sure to post!

Simplified Chinese (简体中文) and partial Russian (Русский) translations! Thanks Arche, Tsar Kapsky, and Rabbitism for your contributions. (NOTE: Full Russian translation coming soon)

In addition, I've fixed a MAJOR crash bug that only affected some people, so if you've had problems in the past, please give HVH another try.

[b]HUNTER v HUNTED[/b] is a fast-paced 4v1 PVP mode that pits teamwork against terror. The balance of power is constantly shifting, requiring players to play offensively one minute and defensively the next. On one team, the four Snipers must watch each other's backs and follow the nose of their trusty Hound. On the other team, the solo Night Stalker must learn to divide and conquer by staging ambushes and cleverly evading capture. This game mode includes a tailored map, custom abilities, AI companions, items that grant Dota 2 abilities, and more. It is designed to be fun with groups of varying skill levels.

[b]OBJECTIVE:[/b]
Each team has limited lives. Kill the other team before they kill you! Games should last 15-25 minutes.
