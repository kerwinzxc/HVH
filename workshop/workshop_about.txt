Version 1.5.0

Simplified Chinese (简体中文) and Russian (Русский) translations available!

[b]WHAT'S NEW?[/b]
A new, customizable ability slot for the Snipers has been added. That means more replayability and wilder games. Whoever kills the Night Stalker first gets first pick on Kardel's sharpshooting, Riggs's hounds, Florax's teleport, or Jebby's secret formula! (See changelog for details) The map has also been overhauled and improved in many places, especially the northeast swamp. Finally, there's been a sweep of balance tweaks to both heroes and neutrals.

I really appreciate the support I've received from all these people I've never met before, and it's inspired me to keep working on the mod. Thank you! Unfortunately, the player counts haven't been very high lately, but perhaps I can find some ways to advertise and turn those numbers around. If you know any ways you can help out, take a moment to post or drop me a message! Maybe we can organize some games together.

[b]HUNTER v HUNTED[/b] is a fast-paced 4v1 PVP mode that pits teamwork against terror. The balance of power is constantly shifting, requiring players to play offensively one minute and defensively the next. On one team, the four Snipers must watch each other's backs and follow the nose of their trusty Hound. On the other team, the solo Night Stalker must learn to divide and conquer by staging ambushes and cleverly evading capture. This game mode includes a tailored map, custom abilities, AI companions, items that grant Dota 2 abilities, and more. It is designed to be fun with groups of varying skill levels.

[b]OBJECTIVE:[/b]
Each team has limited lives. Kill the other team before they kill you! Games should last 15-25 minutes.
