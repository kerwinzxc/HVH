1.0.2
---
Cold snap item charges 2 to 1
Team spawn points for the start of the match, always opposite sides of map
Hound wander radius 150 to 500
Hound delay between warning growls 2 to 4 secs
Nightstalker fade delay split into 3 categories with different durations:
-- Fade delay after attacking/casting: 4.0 (previously 2.0)
-- Fade delay after taking damage: 2.0 (previously none)
-- Fade delay after moving (day only): 0.5 (previously 2.0)
-- Minimum of 25 dmg to break invisibility

These changes make it easier for NS to hide during the day, especially
after pressing the STOP or HALT commands. Takes longer for his
invisibility to fade during the night, though.
